# Armageddon Labs 2026

This is my running log of everything I built for the Armageddon Labs project: EC2, RDS, ALB, CloudFront, WAF, SSM, and all the debugging that came with it.

> ### ⚠️ **Important: Python Validation Evidence**
> All infrastructure in this repository was programmatically verified using Python scripts. **The terminal outputs, script logs, and validation screenshots are located at the end of each PDF document listed below.**

## Lab Evidence & Python Validation

Instead of manual screenshots alone, I used Python scripts to validate the state of the infrastructure. These files contain the visual proof and the execution logs for those automated checks.

### Lab 1: Infrastructure and Security Validation
* **Lab 1A (EC2/RDS Core):** Provisioning of a Python Notes App via EC2 and RDS MySQL, including ALB configuration and API endpoint validation.
  * [View Lab 1A Evidence (Python results at end)](https://github.com/kilik42/armageddon_labs_2026/blob/refactor/lab-redesign/LABS_python%20evidence_pdfs/Lab_1_Redone/LAB_1A_Redone/lab1a_redone_deliverables_evidence.pdf)
* **Lab 1B (Monitoring & SNS):** Implementation of CloudWatch monitoring agents and SNS alerting for automated health tracking and incident notification.
  * [View Lab 1B Evidence (Python results at end)](https://github.com/kilik42/armageddon_labs_2026/blob/refactor/lab-redesign/LABS_python%20evidence_pdfs/Lab_1_Redone/LAB_1B_REDONE/LAB%201B%20Redone.pdf)
* **Lab 1C (WAF Security):** Deployment of AWS WAF with managed rule groups for Layer 7 protection and SSM for secure management access.
  * [View Lab 1C Evidence (Python results at end)](https://github.com/kilik42/armageddon_labs_2026/blob/refactor/lab-redesign/LABS_python%20evidence_pdfs/Lab_1_Redone/Lab_1C_Redone/Lab%201C%20redone.pdf)

### Lab 2: Edge Delivery and SSL Validation
* **Lab 2 (CloudFront):** Implementation of CloudFront CDN with SSL/TLS and validated cache-routing logic for dynamic content.
  * [View Lab 2 Evidence (Python results at end)](https://github.com/kilik42/armageddon_labs_2026/blob/refactor/lab-redesign/LABS_python%20evidence_pdfs/Lab_2_Redone/lab2%20evidence.pdf)

### Lab 3: Multi-Region Networking
* **Lab 3 (Transit Gateway):** Setup and attachment of Transit Gateways (TGW) across multiple regions (SA-East and US-West).
  * [View Lab 3 Evidence (Python results at end)](https://github.com/kilik42/armageddon_labs_2026/blob/refactor/lab-redesign/LABS_python%20evidence_pdfs/Lab_3_redone/evidence%20lab3.pdf)

---

## Technology Stack
* **AWS:** EC2, RDS, ALB, CloudFront, Route53, WAF, SSM, Transit Gateway
* **Automation:** Python (Infrastructure Validation & Testing)
* **IaC:** Terraform
* **OS/App:** Windows Server (IIS), Python-based APIs

---

## Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution
* **CloudFront 504s:** Debugged origin timeout issues by validating ALB listener responses directly before testing through the CDN.
* **Target Group Health:** Resolved connectivity issues between the ALB and EC2 instances by auditing security group ingress rules.
* **SSM Integration:** Established secure management access via VPC endpoints, removing the need for SSH/RDP open to the internet.

## Old  Deliverables (in the docs folder) / This space below shows only cli evidence and aws console evidence. The python evidence is up above.

### 1A – EC2 + RDS Application

- [1A Deployment + App Proof](docs/1a_deliverables/1_a.pdf)

Highlights:
- EC2 instance running application
- RDS database connectivity
- API endpoints functional

---

### 1B – CloudWatch Monitoring

- [CloudWatch Agent Setup](docs/1b_deliverables/cloud%20watch%20agent%20running.pdf)

Highlights:
- CloudWatch agent installed on EC2
- Logs and metrics collection
- Observability pipeline validated

---

### 1C – Advanced Infrastructure (ALB + Route53 + Debugging)

- [Bonus C](docs/1c_deliverables/1%20c%20bonus%20c.pdf)

Highlights:
- Application Load Balancer configured
- Route53 domain mapping verified
- Target group debugging (health checks, timeouts)

Key Issue:
- Target group initially unhealthy (timeout issue)
- Required fixing backend service and networking

---

### 1C Bonus A – SSM + Private Infrastructure

- [Bonus A Outputs](docs/1c_deliverables/1C%20BONUS%20A%20OUTPUTS_DELIVERABLE.pdf)

Highlights:
- SSH-free access using SSM
- VPC endpoints for:
  - SSM
  - EC2 Messages
  - Secrets Manager
- Secure internal communication

---

### 1C Bonus B – VPC Deep Dive

- [Bonus B](docs/1c_deliverables/1c%20bonus%20B.pdf)

Highlights:
- Verified subnets, route tables, internet gateway, and NAT gateway
- Validated full VPC configuration

---

## Lab 2 – CloudFront, Caching, and API Routing

- [Lab 2A](docs/lab_2/lab%202a.pdf)
- [Lab 2B](docs/lab_2/2b_Be_A_Man.pdf)

This lab demonstrates:

- CloudFront distribution setup
- ALB as origin
- Static and API routing behavior
- Caching configuration

Evidence:

Initial failure:
- CloudFront returned 502/504 errors for both static and API endpoints  
- Example shown in logs

Root cause:
- ALB worked directly
- CloudFront to ALB failed
- Indicates origin connectivity or configuration issue

Validation:
- ALB returned successful responses
- CloudFront distribution confirmed
- DNS correctly pointed to CloudFront  

Configuration and validation steps
